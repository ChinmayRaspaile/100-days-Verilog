# 4-bit Johnson Counter Implementation in Verilog

## Overview
A **4-bit Johnson Counter** is a type of shift register counter that cycles through a sequence of states by feeding the inverted output of the last flip-flop back to the input of the first.

It produces a repeating sequence of 2n unique states for an n-bit Johnson counter, making it useful in applications requiring timing control and sequence generation.

This project implements a **4-bit Johnson Counter** using behavioral modeling in Verilog.

---

## How to Run
1. Copy the module and testbench into a Verilog simulator (Vivado, ModelSim, etc.).
2. Compile and run the testbench.
3. Observe the output waveform or console to verify the counter sequence.

---

## Expected Output
The Johnson counter cycles through 8 unique states:

```
0000
0001
0011
0111
1111
1110
1100
1000
```

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **4-bit Johnson Counter** using behavioral modeling. The testbench confirms its proper cyclic behavior across multiple clock cycles.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
