# 4-bit Ring Counter Implementation in Verilog

## Overview
A **4-bit Ring Counter** is a type of shift register where the output of the last flip-flop is connected to the input of the first. It circulates a single high bit (`1`) across all flip-flops in a circular fashion.

This project implements a **4-bit Ring Counter** using **behavioral modeling** in Verilog.

## How to Run
1. Copy the Verilog module and testbench into a Verilog simulator (Vivado, ModelSim, etc.).
2. Compile and simulate the testbench.
3. Observe the waveform or terminal output.

## Expected Output
The single '1' will rotate across the 4-bit output:

| Time     | Reset | Q     |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 0        | 1     | 0001   |
| 10000    | 0     | 0001   |
| 15000    | 0     | 0010   |
| 25000    | 0     | 0100   |
| 35000    | 0     | 1000   |
| 45000    | 0     | 0001   |
| ...      | ...   | ...    |

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a **4-bit Ring Counter** using behavioral Verilog. The counter reliably cycles a single high bit across all outputs, which is verified through a clear and concise testbench.
